            <h2>Why Sublime Text</h2>
            <p>In most LaTeX tutorials, the author will recommend you to use WinEdt and TeXMake. These are good choice, but as developers, we already have dozens of tools for text editor. We don't want another one just for LaTeX. Can't we just do it with our most frequently used tools ? And that is where Sublime Text comes in.</p>
            <p>Front-end developers can't be too familiar with Sublime Text. It is THE AWESOME TOOL that 9 out of 10 developers are using it. Its popularity and extendibility, even when comparing with Eclipse, shows no disadvantage. Sublime Text had syntax highlight for LaTeX built in. But it doesn't contain TeX, which means it can't compile. So we need a little configuration before we start to use it. Here I'm gonna demostrate how to do it on Windows platform. (If your are using OSX or Linux, follow this article: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools/blob/master/README.markdown">https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools/blob/master/README.markdown</a>)</p>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>Before we start, we need to download all the gears we need and install them.</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" id="download_list">
        		<tr>
        			<td align="center">MiKTeX</td>
        			<td>An up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs for Windows</td>
        			<td align="center"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.miktex.org/download">Download</a></td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td align="center">Sublime Text</td>
        			<td>The text editor you'll fall in love with. Perfect for Front-end Development</td>
        			<td align="center"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Download</a></td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td align="center">LaTeX Tools</td>
        			<td>A Sublime Text Plugin for writing LaTeX. <strong>Package Control is strongly recommended to install this package.</strong> If you need an offline package. Click the link on the right.</td>
        			<td align="center"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools">Download</a></td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td align="center">Sumatra PDF</td>
        			<td>A free PDF reader, LaTeXTools by default use it to preview the created PDF file.</td>
        			<td align="center"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/download-free-pdf-viewer.html">Download</a></td>
        		</tr>
        	</table>

			<h2>Configure LaTeXTools</h2>
			<p>Open Sublime Text. Press <span class="code">Ctrl</span>+<span class="code">Shift</span>+<span class="code">P</span> to pull out Package Control. Search for "LaTeXTools: Reconfigure and migrate settings" and hit enter. And it's done. This command creates a configuration file named "LaTeXTools.sublime-settings" in your "User" directory.</p>

			<h2>Configure SumatraPDF</h2>
			<p>Step 1:  add the SumatraPDF directory to your <span class="code">PATH</span>, This is important, or the next step won't work.</p>
			<p>Step 2: Open up a command-line console (cmd.exe) and type in the following code:(change the install path into yours)</p>
			<pre><code>sumatrapdf.exe -inverse-search "\"C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3\sublime_text.exe\" \"%f:%l\""</code></pre>
			
			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<p>By now, the configuration is done. WE can start writing LaTeX with Sublime Text. Every time you done editing a tex file. Save it (If you just created a new tex file, you must save it before you build it. Or it won't know what file this is). Press <span class="code">Ctrl</span>+<span class="code">B</span>. Sublime Text would build the file using LaTeXTools. When it's done. SumatraPDF will open up automatically and let you preview your work. The preview will auto-update itself after a new build, all you need to do is press <span class="code">Ctrl</span>+<span class="code">B</span>.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Now we can use our favourite text editor to write LaTeX. Perfect isn't it ?</p>
